## Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Cloud DevOps Engineer specializing in Kubernetes.

- 🛜 Connect with me on the Fediverse @ https://mastodon.social/@geiser

My journey started when I was just a curious 👦🏻 12-year-old kid, begging my mom to buy me the book _"Hackers 4 - Secrets & Solutions for Network Security"_ (freely translated from Spanish) published by McGraw Hill. I still get chills thinking about it! 

Honestly though, after reading it, I realized I'd prefer building things rather than breaking ⚡ them. Fast forward over two decades, and here I am—fully embracing life in the cloud, building and scaling apps, and loving every second of it.
